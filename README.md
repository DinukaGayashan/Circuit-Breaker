Circuit breaker for microservice intercommunication.

## Description

Circuit breaker refers to a design pattern that is used to enhance the stability and resilience of a system composed of multiple microservices.

In a microservice architecture, various services communicate with each other over the network. If one service is experiencing issues, such as high latency, unavailability, or errors, it can potentially affect the overall performance and reliability of the entire system. The circuit breaker pattern aims to mitigate these issues by providing a mechanism to detect and handle failures in a more controlled manner.
